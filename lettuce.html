            <li class="wer">Finding the right place</li>
            <p class="rew">
                The first step which is important as we want to grow our green garden is to find the right place. Most
                greens and vegetables grow where there is enough sunlight. Keep your place as much as possible away from
                strogn wind spots in your area as it will not let your greens have an on time grow.Stay far away from
                trees; a dense leaf canopy casts too much shade, and thirsty tree roots quickly grow into veggie-garden
                soil and out-compete your crops. The best season for sowing starts between May and June for most
                of the vegetables and green leafs/Herbs planting times.
            </p>
            <li class="wer"> Plant in Pots or Blocks</li>
            <p class="rew"> It is preferable to grow vegetables and green leaf plants for consumption in soil lengthwise
                to have a better contribution for the green bed, in order to handle and take care of them more easy
                going and have a better sunlight covered surface. A better idea, especially on a small plot, is to plant
                in blocks with the same spacing in all directions. Stay on the paths between the beds and avoid
                compacting
                the soil. This virtually eliminates the need for tilling and heavy digging. If you use organic
                matter to add extra depth, work it in to improve the soil at the same time and keep the soil wet 55%-70%
                of the time.. </p>
            <li class="wer"> Choose the right Variety</li>
            <p class="rew"> It hasn't been more easy to choose lettuce variety for our garden! Keep in mind that all the
                green lettuces have similar consistant and the value to our table is alsmost the same.
                There are many
                varieties available online or at the store which some of them are:
            <ul class="them" style="list-style-type: square;">
                <li class="cos"> <b><i> Arugula</i></b></li>
                <li class="cos"><b><i> Butterhead lettuce</i></b></li>
                <li class="cos"><b><i>Coral lettuce</i></b></li>
                <li class="cos"><b><i>Little gem lettuce</i></b></li>
                <li class="cos"><b><i>Red sails lettuce</i></b></li>
                <li class="cos"><b><i>Red leaf</i></b></li>
                <li class="cos"><b><i>Romaine</i></b></li>
                <li class="cos"><b><i>Mesclun</i></b></li>
                <li class="cos"><b><i>Green leaf</i></b></li>
                <li class="cos"><b><i>Iceberg</i></b></li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <li class="wer">Watering your garden</li>
            <p class="rew"> Water young seedlings and newly transplanted lettuces regularly, especially in warm weather.
                To get the best results, lettuces will prefer a fertile soil, ideally one that was improved with
                well-rotted organic matter last autumn.</p>
            <li class="wer">Let your self make mistakes to learn from them</li>
            <p class="rew"> One more important but not neccecary step is to let our selfs to make mistakes as we learn
                from them in order to become better on what we are doing. Heat stress and bolting can occur in plants
                that are not watered frequently enough. Such crops are no longer marketable. Overwatering is also
                undesirable because of the increased risk of root rot and fungal diseases. Some experience needed after
                our first attmept on sowing lettuces and vegetables. Don't be afraid of them.</p>
            <li class="wer">Be aware of bugs and pests</li>
            <p class="rew">Keep plants as healthy as possible by supplying good soil, adequate moisture, and nutrition
                to maximize plant immune systems. Strong, healthy plants fight off bug and disease pressure readily.
                Monitor regularly for early signs of trouble, but donâ€™t just spray the whole garden at the first sign of
                something crawling.It's always a more safe way to ask at the garden store for the right bug control
                preventer as each case is different. </p>
            <li class="wer"> How long does it lasts from start to end?</li>
            <p class="rew"> The total time in days is 40 to 60 days after planting. After about three weeks from sowing
                you will need to thin your plants to 5cm (2 inches)
                apart. Then from 5 weeks after sowing you will be able to
                remove further young leaves and progressively thin out your plants. Without taking the risk to wait
                longer thatn that,
                most lettuces will be ready to harvest as a whole just 10 weeks after sowing. It is always in your hand
                to harvest when you need it, even is if is not evenly grown. Your patience will pay you off after these
                weeks.</p>
